Harvest from multiple sources, not just the first one:
    - store source id in creep memory?
        this seems good as it can easily be adapted to using links and/or
        containers/storage

cache paths somewhere to avoid recalculating common paths each tick

Rewrite roles as prototypes? (find a way to reduce common code, like harvesting/refilling behaviours).
