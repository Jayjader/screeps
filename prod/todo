Add tiers to creep auto-spawning depending on:
    - how much energy is available?
    - how much energy can be stored?
    - how many creeps are alive?
    - which tier creeps are alive?
    etc?

Rewrite roles as prototypes? (find a way to reduce common code, like harvesting/refilling behaviours).

Seperate harvesting and refilling/refueling of creeps so that eventually harvesters can be split into harvesters and gatherers)
